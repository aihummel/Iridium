A cute little graphing tool

Just a fun project in my free time; inspired by Desmos.com.
Original was called Osmium, renamed after function-parsing algorithm overhaul

N.B. syntax is as you would expect for everything except logarithms; "log" acts like an operation, just like "+" or "/"--the base goes before the word "log" and the operand goes after, e.g. 2logx. There is no "ln" at this time: lnx is elogx.
